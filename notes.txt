Notes:
Best algorithm?
is this feasable with processing constraints?

  ffmpeg -framerate 30 -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' \
  -i audio.ogg -c:a copy -shortest -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4

Process:
- Extract audio, save for later
- from video, extract each frame
  - run through upscale
- re-stitch back together

import os

input = ""
output = ""
command = "realsr-ncnn-vulkan.exe -i " + input + " -o " + output + " -s 4"
os.system(command)


For each file in folder:
  run vidlen, get frames
  n threads - repeat frameExtract(a) while a < vidlen+1
  n threads - repeat frameUpscale()
  find framerate of original file
  extract audio from original file
  merge with funky ffmpeg command (above)
